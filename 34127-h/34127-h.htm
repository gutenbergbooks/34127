<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Variation of selected taxonomic characteristics of flat-headed snakes (<i>Tantilla
gracilis</i> Baird and Girard) from several midwestern states was studied by
Force (1935), but she did not attempt a comprehensive evaluation. Taylor
(1936) reported on variation in <i>T. gracilis</i> from various localities in Kansas;
Kirn, Burger, and Smith (1949) studied selected structures of specimens of
<i>T. gracilis</i> from throughout its range. The present study was undertaken to
determine the variation in both currently used and potential taxonomic characteristics
of <i>T. gracilis</i> from one locality.</p>

<p>We are thankful to Charles W. Myers, Gorgas Memorial Laboratory, for
suggestions concerning characteristics examined. We are indebted to Drs.
William G. Degenhardt, University of New Mexico, Herndon G. Dowling,
New York Zoological Society, Charles H. Lowe, University of Arizona, and
Richard G. Zweifel, American Museum of Natural History, for criticizing the
manuscript. Dr. William E. Duellman permitted us to study specimens in the
University of Kansas Museum of Natural History.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>Materials and Methods</h3>


<p>The specimens examined were donated to the Museum of Natural History,
University of Kansas, by the late Paul Anderson of Independence, Missouri.
All specimens (KU numbers 83435-83680; N = 246) were collected in the
vicinity of Winfield, Cowley County, Kansas, by Charles E. Burt and students
from Southwestern College in the period from 1938 to 1941, inclusive.</p>

<p>Both authors gathered data on most characteristics and examined each
atypical individual. Hardy determined characters of the maxillae (which were
removed; N = 20), body and total lengths, and the scale formula of KU 83620.</p>

<p>We examined 22 characteristics of external morphology and 10 of the
maxillae. All paired characteristics (excepting those of the maxillae) were
examined on both sides of each snake and are referred to from the left side
to the right side (for example, "preoculars 1-2" means there is one preocular
on the left side and there are two on the right). Oviducts and oviducal eggs
were observed on specimens designated as females; hemipenes were examined
on specimens designated as males. Total length was measured by straightening
each snake along a 300 mm. scale. Tail length was measured only on snakes
having complete tails, and body length (snout-vent) was considered as total
length minus tail length. The body length was measured on snakes having
incomplete tails.<!-- Page 616 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span></p>

<p>Supralabials, infralabials, preoculars and postoculars were counted, and we
followed Peters (1960:9) in determining the nature of the temporals. Occasionally
the primary (anterior) temporal is separated from the postocular by
contact of the parietal and a supralabial (Taylor, 1936:338). We followed
Peters (1964:219-220) in determining characteristics of the nasal and we looked
for contact of the prefrontal with particular supralabials (Taylor, 1936:338).
We determined which supralabials are in contact with the eye and whether the
mental is in contact with the anterior pair of chin-shields.</p>

<p>The number of rows of dorsal scales was determined at five locations:
a) around the neck&mdash;counts were made from each side diagonally and posteriorly
from the anteriormost dorsal scale in contact with the first ventral (see
below)&mdash;counts from the left and right sides are the first and second counts,
respectively, recorded in the scale formula; b) one head length posterior to
head&mdash;counts were made either diagonally and posteriorly or in a zig-zag
pattern, beginning at the end of the second count around the neck&mdash;this is
the third count recorded in the scale formula; c) midbody (approximated)&mdash;counts
were made either diagonally and posteriorly or in a zig-zag pattern&mdash;this
is the fourth count in the scale formula; d) anterior to anus (preanal)&mdash;counts
were made in a zig-zag pattern beginning on one side and ending on
the other at the first dorsal scale in contact with the anal plate&mdash;this is the
fifth count in the scale formula.</p>

<p>We followed the method of Dowling (1951:98-99) in counting ventrals,
and the anal plate was determined as entire, divided, or partly divided. Subcaudals
were counted on only the right side beginning at the first scale that
contacts a corresponding scale from the opposite side; fusion of particular pairs
of subcaudals was determined. The "spine" at the tip of the tail was not
counted. The head scutellation of each specimen was examined for abnormalities.</p>

<p>We determined the number of fangs and the number of maxillary teeth
anterior to them and recorded the presence or absence of a diastema between
the anterior fang and the maxillary tooth immediately preceding it. The
diastema, if present, is a space distinctly wider than the spaces separating the
prediastemal teeth.</p>

<p>The point of intersection of two perpendicular lines of an ocular grid determined
which tooth-socket occurs directly opposite the distal tip of the
suborbital process (<a href="#FIG_5">Fig. 5b</a>), but if that point occurs between two sockets
then the number recorded was the number of the tooth immediately anterior
to that point plus one-half.</p>

<p>The anterior and posterior edges of the suborbital process were determined
as parallel or not at any point by aligning them with parallel lines on an
ocular grid (<a href="#FIG_5">Fig. 5b</a>).</p>

<p>The angle of the posterior edge of the lateral flange was determined as an
acute, obtuse, or right angle by fitting it to a pair of perpendicular lines of an
ocular grid (<a href="#FIG_5">Fig. 5b</a>).</p>

<p>The number of lateral anterior foramina (<a href="#FIG_4">Fig. 4b</a>) was determined. If
only two are present, their lengths (anterior to posterior) were compared by
measuring them with an ocular micrometer. Also, if two lateral anterior
foramina are present, the point of intersection of two perpendicular lines of
an ocular grid determined which tooth-socket occurs directly below the center
of the posterior foramen (<a href="#FIG_4">Fig. 4b</a>).<!-- Page 617 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="RESULTS" id="RESULTS"></a>RESULTS</h2>


<h3>General Characteristics</h3>

<p>From the data given by Force (1935), Taylor (1936), and Kirn <i>et al.</i>
(1949), and from our own data, we conclude that a typical specimen of
<i>gracilis</i>, meaning a specimen having the usual characteristics of the species,
has the following characteristics in combination: supralabials 6-6; infralabials
6-6; preoculars 1-1; postoculars 1-1; temporals 1 + 1 on each side; nasal
divided below naris; supralabials 3 + 4 entering orbit; mental in contact with
chin-shields; all five dorsal scale counts 15; and plate divided. (In the present
work we use the words usual, unusual, typical, and atypical with neither quotation
marks nor apology).</p>

<p>Of the 244 specimens on which we could examine each of these characteristics,
only 125 (51.2%) have all of the typical characteristics in combination.
The 119 specimens that do not possess all of the typical characteristics in
combination include 31 (12.7% of the 244) that lack at least two of the typical
characteristics.</p>


<h3>Sex</h3>

<p>The sample (N = 246) is composed of 107 (43.5%) females and 139
(56.5%) males.</p>


<h3>Measurements</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="FIG_1" id="FIG_1"></a>
<a href="images/i_005.jpg"><img src="images/i_005_tn.jpg" width="400" height="402" alt="" title="[Linked to larger image of Figure 1.]" /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 1. Ratio of tail length to total
length in females and males of <i>T.
gracilis</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>Females have total lengths from 96 to 244 mm. (mean, 173.3; N = 79).
One female (KU 83480) measuring 244 mm. may be the longest specimen
known (Conant, 1958, reports the longest as 9-1/8 inches&mdash;approximately 232
mm.). Males have total lengths from 96 to 215 mm. (mean, 162.4; N = 109).
Females have tail lengths from 16 to 50 mm. (mean, 34.6; N = 79), and males
have tail lengths from 21 to 53 mm.
(mean, 37.8; N = 109).</p>

<p>The ratio of tail length to total
length in females is from 0.17 to 0.22
(mean, 0.20; N = 79); in males it is
from 0.21 to 0.27 (mean, 0.23;
N = 109; <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>). Juveniles (those
less than 125 mm. in total length according
to Force, 1935: tables 1 and
2) have proportionally shorter tails
than do adults; the ratio of tail length
divided by total length is 0.17-0.21
(mean, 0.18; N = 14) in females and
0.21-0.23 (mean, 0.22; N = 16) in
males. Adult females (125 mm. or
more in total length) have ratios from
0.18 to 0.22 (mean, 0.20; N = 65)
and adult males have ratios from 0.21
to 0.27 (mean, 0.23; N = 93).</p>

<p>Of the 246 specimens examined, 58 have incomplete tails. Of these 58
specimens, six had freshly broken tails, so we assume that 52 (21.1% of the 246)
have incomplete tails resulting from natural causes; the remaining six specimens<!-- Page 618 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span>
could have had their tails broken at or soon after capture, assuming that none
of the snakes was retained in captivity for an extended period.</p>


<h3>Supralabials</h3>

<p>The supralabials are either six (usually) or seven on a side (<a href="#Table_1">Table 1</a>).
When seven supralabials are present on either one or both sides, the addition
results from one of the following conditions: a) 5 is divided to form 5 and 6
(N = 6); b) 2 and 3 form 2, 3, and 4 (N = 1); c) 5 and 6 form 5, 6, and 7
(N = 12); d) 4, 5, and 6 form 4, 5, 6, and 7 (N = 1); e) 1 and 2 form 1, 2,
and 3 (N = 1); f) 1, 2, and 3 form 1, 2, 3, and 4 (N = 1); g) 2 is fused
with the nasal, and 3 and 4 are reduced to granules (N = 1); h) type of
addition unknown (N = 5).</p>

</table></div>


<p>In three of the four specimens with 7-7 supralabials, the type of addition
is the same on each side, whereas the other specimen has a different type of
addition on each side. Of the 23 examples for which the type of addition is
known, 19 (82.6%) have the increase in number on the posterior half of the
series.</p>

<p>In one specimen the third supralabial on the right is diagonally divided and
the resulting upper part does not contact the edge of the lip; hence the specimen
has 6-6 supralabials.</p>


<h3>Infralabials</h3>

<p>The infralabials are five, six (usually), or seven on a side (<a href="#Table_1">Table 1</a>). When
five infralabials are present on either one or both sides, the reduction results
from one of the following conditions: a) 2 and 3 are fused (N = 3); b) 1, 2,
and 3 form 1 and 2 (N = 6); c) 2, 3, and 4 form 2 and 3 (N = 3); d) 5 is
separated from the edge of the lip by a projection from an adjacent infralabial
(N = 1); e) 1, 2, 3, and 4 form 1, 2, and 3 (N = 2); f) type of reduction
unknown (N = 4).</p>

<p>Of the specimens with 5-5 infralabials, two have the same type of reduction
on each side, one has a different type of reduction on each side, and the type
of reduction is unknown for the other two specimens.</p>

<p>When seven infralabials are present on either one or both sides, the addition
can result from infralabials 2 and 3 forming 2, 3, and 4 (N = 2); the type
of addition is unknown in one specimen.<!-- Page 619 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span></p>

<p>In one specimen the second infralabial on the right side is reduced to a
small wedge-shaped granule and in another specimen several infralabials on
both sides are irregularly divided horizontally, although both specimens have
six infralabials on the sides having the abnormalities.</p>


<h3>Preoculars</h3>

<p>Of the 245 specimens examined, 242 (98.8%) have one preocular on each
side. Both preoculars are absent from two specimens, and one specimen has
1-0. In each case when a preocular is lacking, the "preocular" and prefrontal
are fused. One specimen having 1-1 preoculars has both of them reduced to
small vertical slivers.</p>


<h3>Postoculars</h3>

<p>Of the 245 specimens examined, 242 (98.8%) have one postocular on each
side. Postoculars are 2-1 in two specimens and 1-2 in one. In one specimen
the lower of the two postoculars on each side is very small, being approximately
1/6 the diameter of the upper one (measured with an ocular micrometer).</p>


<h3>Temporals</h3>

<p>Of the 245 specimens examined, 235 (95.9%) have 1 + 1 temporals on each
side. Four specimens exhibit addition of temporals: one specimen has two
secondary temporals on the left, and one has a tertiary temporal on the left.
Two specimens have partly healed head injuries that probably caused atypical
temporal conditions: one specimen has two primary temporals on the left,
and one has two secondary temporals on the left and two upper and one lower
secondary temporal on the right.</p>

<p>Six specimens exhibit reduction of temporals: one lacks a primary temporal
on the left ("temporal" is fused with sixth supralabial), two lack secondary
temporals on the right, and three lack secondary temporals on the left. The
right secondary "temporal" of one specimen is separated from the supralabials
by a posterior extension of the primary temporal.</p>

<p>Of the 246 specimens examined, 200 (81.3%) have both primary temporals
in contact with their adjacent postoculars. Thirteen specimens (5.3%) have
only the left primary temporal in contact with the postocular and eight (3.3%)
have only the right primary temporal in contact with the postocular. Twenty-five
specimens (10.2%) have both primary temporals separated from the postoculars.
Separation of the primary temporal from the postocular, whenever
it occurs, results from contact of mutual extensions from the adjacent parietal
and supralabial (usually the fifth).</p>


<h3>Nasal</h3>

<p>Of the 243 specimens examined, 237 (97.5%) have the nasal divided below
the naris on both sides. Three specimens have the nasal completely divided
(above and below the naris) on only the left side; one specimen has a completely
divided nasal on only the right side. A groove, but not a complete
division of the nasal, is present above the left naris of one specimen. One
specimen lacks the typical division below the naris on both sides, but a complete
suture is present posterior to the naris and the resulting postnasal scales are,
according to position, loreals.<!-- Page 620 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span></p>


<h3>Contact of prefrontal with supralabials</h3>

<p>Of the 243 specimens examined, 147 (60.5%) have the prefrontal separated
from the labials on each side. Of the remaining 96 specimens, 53 (21.8% of
the 243) have the prefrontals in contact with the second labial on each side;
five other variations of this characteristic were observed (<a href="#Table_2">Table 2</a>).</p>

</table></div>

<p>The specimen having the prefrontal in contact with labial 2 on the left and
labial 3 on the right has seven supralabials on the right, the extra labial being
added anterior to the eye. In two of the three specimens with the prefrontals
in contact with labial 3 on the left and labial 2 on the right, the preoculars and
prefrontals are fused on each side; the third specimen has each preocular
reduced to a small vertical sliver. Of the three specimens having the prefrontals
in contact with labial 2 on the left and labials 2 and 3 on the right,
two are typical with respect to other characteristics that might result in this
atypical condition, but one has the prefrontals and preoculars fused.</p>


<h3>Supralabials entering orbit</h3>

<p>Of the 246 specimens examined, 233 (94.7%) have the third and fourth
supralabials entering each eye (<a href="#Table_3">Table 3</a>). All snakes that have the fourth and
fifth labials entering the orbit on either side also have seven supralabials on
the same side. One specimen having only the fourth labial entering the eye
on the right side also has six supralabials on that side, but the third supralabial
is split diagonally and the part contacting the eye does not contact the lip
and hence is not a supralabial. The remaining three atypical conditions
(4/3 + 4; 3 + 4/3 + 4 + 5; 3 + 4 + 5/3 + 4) occur only one time each and
on snakes having 6-6 supralabials.</p>


<h3>Contact of mental with chin-shields</h3>

<p>Of the 246 specimens examined, 190 (77.2%) have the mental in contact
with both anterior chin-shields. The mental is in contact with only the left
anterior chin-shield in 15 specimens, only the right anterior chin-shield in 2<!-- Page 621 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>
specimens, and the mental does not contact either anterior chin-shield in 39

<h3>Dorsal scale rows</h3>

<p>Of the 245 specimens examined for this characteristic, 228 (92.7%) have
scale counts of 15-15-15-15-15. The number of scale rows around the neck
and one head length behind the head are 15 except in a single specimen that
has 14 scale rows at these three places. The number of scale rows around
midbody is 15 in 244 of 246 specimens (99.2%); two specimens have 14 scale
rows around midbody. The number of preanal scale rows is more variable;
counts of 14 through 17 were recorded. Fourteen specimens have 14 preanal
scale rows (5.7%), 229 have 15 preanal rows (93.1%), two have 16 preanal rows
(0.8%), and one has 17 preanal rows (0.4%). Known causes for atypical
numbers of preanal scale rows are listed in <a href="#Table_4">Table 4</a>. A preanal count at one
head length anterior to the anus would have omitted most of the above variation
in numbers of preanal scale rows.</p>

<p>The complete dorsal scale formula for KU 83620, a male, is as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_010a.jpg" width="600" height="316"

longdesc="#dorsal_scale_formula_text"
title="[Complete dorsal scale formula.]" />
<p class="center"><a href="#dorsal_scale_formula_text">[Textual representation of dorsal scale formula.]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Specimen 83620 is the only one for which we have determined the complete
dorsal scale formula. Obviously the formula is complex, and possibly the
specimen is atypical in this regard. Nevertheless, addition and reduction of
scale rows is apparent on other specimens and can be easily observed by
examining specimens under a dissection microscope.</p>


<h3>Anal plate</h3>

<p>Of the 246 specimens examined, 232 (94.3%) have the anal plate divided.
Of the 14 specimens having undivided anal plates, four have an incomplete
groove anteriorly in the plate.</p>


<h3>Ventrals</h3>

<p>Females have from 122 to 137 (mean, 130.8 ± 0.26; N = 107) ventrals;
males have from 117 to 131 (mean, 122.3 ± 0.21; N = 139; <a href="#FIG_2">Fig. 2</a>). Of the
246 specimens examined, 29 (11.8%; 11 females and 18 males) have an added<!-- Page 623 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>
half-ventral immediately anterior to the anal plate. Of these specimens, 27
have the added half-ventral on the left side and two have it on the right. Five
specimens have the last ventral divided similar to the normal division of the
anal plate. One specimen has the last ventral incompletely divided transversely.
Excluding the last ventral, seven specimens have divided ventrals
(half-ventrals). Four of these specimens have added half-ventrals on the
right side (two specimens with one half-ventral each, one specimen with two
half-ventrals, and one specimen with three half-ventrals), and four have added
half-ventrals on the left side (one half-ventral on each specimen).</p>

</div>



<h3>Subcaudals</h3>

<p>Females have from 37 to 47 (mean, 42.0 ± 0.20; N = 79) subcaudals;
males have from 43 to 55 (mean, 48.4 ± 0.23; N = 109; <a href="#FIG_3">Fig. 3</a>). Of the 187
specimens examined, 13 (7.0%) have the last pair of subcaudals fused. One
specimen has left subcaudal 28 fused with both adjacent subcaudals (also
fused) on the right. While reading proof we found two omissions in <a href="#FIG_3">Fig. 3</a>;
there should be illustrated two males with 43 subcaudals and three males with
44 subcaudals.</p>

</div>


<h3>Ventrals minus subcaudals</h3>

<p>The value for number of ventrals minus the number of subcaudals varies
from 80 to 96 (mean, 88.8 ± 0.39) for 79 females, and from 67 to 83 (mean,
73.8 ± 0.28) for 109 males.</p>


<h3>Additional scale characteristics</h3>

<p>Of the 246 specimens examined, four (1.6%) have the rostral in contact with
the left prefrontal, and hence the internasals are separated from one another.
One snake has approximately one-fourth (anteriorly) of the suture between
the parietals fused. One specimen has the posterior edge of the frontal fused
with the left parietal. One specimen has the parietal shield on the right side
abbreviated posteriorly. One specimen has both prefrontals fused with the
frontal, although an incomplete suture is present.<!-- Page 624 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span></p>


<h3>Maxillary characteristics (<i>Figs. <a href="#FIG_4">4</a> and <a href="#FIG_5">5</a></i>)</h3>

<p>Maxillary teeth anterior to fangs 10-14 (mean, 12.1; N = 20); tooth-socket
number 6.5-8.5 (mean, 7.2; N = 20) directly opposite distal tip of suborbital
process; lateral anterior foramina 1-3 (mean, 1.8; N = 20); tooth number 6-9
(mean, 6.9; N = 12) directly below center of posterior foramen (if only two
foramina present). Three specimens lack a diastema and 17 specimens have
a diastema. The anterior and posterior edges of the suborbital process are
parallel in two specimens and not parallel in 14; the process is broken in four
specimens. The lengths (anterior to posterior) of the lateral anterior foramina
(if only two are present) are approximately equal in six specimens, and in six
the anteriormost one is the longest; six specimens have one foramen and two
specimens have three foramina. All specimens examined have two fangs, with
the posterior edge of the lateral flange forming an obtuse angle.</p>

<h3>Discussion and Conclusions</h3>

<p>Generic characteristics of <i>Tantilla</i> are as follows: size small, body slender,
head not noticeably distinct from body; preoculars one; postoculars one or two;
nasals two; loreal absent; smooth dorsal scales in 15 rows; anal plate usually
divided but sometimes single; subcaudals paired; usually two enlarged, posterior,
grooved fangs on the maxilla separated by a small diastema from the
other maxillary teeth (Baird and Girard, 1853:131; Cope, 1900:1110; Dunn,
1928:24; Blanchard, 1938:369; Schmidt and Davis, 1941:268; Wright and
Wright, 1957:722; Conant, 1958:180). Of these characteristics, only the fol<!-- Page 625 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span>lowing
were invariable in our sample: size small, body slender, head not noticeably
distinct from body; postoculars one or two; smooth dorsal scales; posterior
grooved fangs on maxilla. The dorsal scales, anal, and subcaudals were
"correct" 92 per cent of the time; the preoculars and nasals were "correct" 97
per cent of the time.</p>

<p><i>Tantilla</i> reportedly has two nasals (Baird and Girard, 1853:131; Cope,
1900:1110; Wright and Wright, 1957:722). <i>Tantilla gracilis</i> usually has a
single nasal that is divided below the naris; variation in this characteristic is
discussed above.</p>

<p>In addition to the generic characteristics, specific characteristics for <i>T.
gracilis</i> are as follows: supralabials 5-8 (usually 6); supralabials 3 and 4 entering
orbit; infralabials 5-7 (usually 6); temporals 1 + 1; ventrals 115-138 in
females, 106-132 in males; subcaudals 33-53 in females, 40-57 in males; tail
length 13-27 per cent total length in females, 15-30 per cent in males (Baird
and Girard, 1853:132; Cope, 1900:1111-12; Force, 1935:653-54; Taylor, 1936:337-38;
Blanchard, 1938:371-72; Kirn, Burger, and Smith, 1949:240-49).
Excepting the number of temporals and the supralabials entering the orbit,
the characteristics of the specimens in our sample are within the ranges of
variation mentioned above. Of the 10 maxillary characteristics studied, no
variation was observed in number of fangs or angle of lateral flange.</p>

<p>Because our data have some bearing on the problem of geographic variation
in <i>T. gracilis</i> and the recognition of subspecies, we comment briefly on the
status of subspecies in <i>T. gracilis</i>. Kirn, Burger and Smith (1949) proposed
the recognition of two subspecies of <i>Tantilla gracilis</i> (<i>T. g. gracilis</i> Baird and
Girard and <i>T. g. hallowelli</i> Cope). These subspecies were diagnosed on the<!-- Page 626 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
basis of differences in ventrals, subcaudals, and the ratio of tail length to total
length; sexual dimorphism in each characteristic was considered. We do not
recognize these subspecies for the reasons given below.</p>

<p>The data of Kirn <i>et al.</i> (1949) appear to be presented inaccurately in part.
Both of us independently recalculated the mean given for each characteristic
for each subspecies, using the data in figures 2-4 of Kirn <i>et al.</i> (1949:242,
244-245). Of their 12 means presented (table 1, p. 247) only two agree with
our recalculated means, although the means calculated by each of us independently
are in complete agreement (<a href="#Table_5">Table 5</a>). Also, we independently
calculated the percentages of specimens of each "subspecies" that are included
in the ranges of variation given in their diagnoses (<a href="#Table_5">Table 5</a>); again, our independent
calculations are in complete agreement. In our opinion the differences
between the populations for the characteristics analyzed do not warrant
recognition of subspecies (<a href="#FIG_6">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The data presented by Kirn <i>et al.</i> do not demonstrate intergradation between
two populations. Moreover, the diagnostic ranges of the number of subcaudals
in males of <i>hallowelli</i> and the ratio of tail length to total length in males of
<i>gracilis</i> do not include the recalculated means for those characteristics. Furthermore,
the means for the following characteristics are dangerously close to being
excluded from their respective "diagnostic" ranges: in <i>hallowelli</i>, the number
of ventrals in males; in <i>gracilis</i>, the number of subcaudals in females, and the
ratio of tail length to total length in females. It is incongruous that Kirn <i>et al.</i>
state (p. 243) that "the coefficient of geographic divergence is .6 per degree
latitude" for ventrals, and on the same page they state that "The average
number of ventrals gradually increases toward the north in <i>Tantilla gracilis</i>
except in southern Oklahoma and central Arkansas (the area of intergradation
between <i>T. g. gracilis</i> and <i>T. g. hallowelli</i>) where the change seems to be more
abrupt." The data presented in Kirn <i>et al.</i> (1949) do not demonstrate an
abrupt change.</p>

<p>The present sample of <i>T. gracilis</i> from Kansas is clearly within the geographic
range of <i>T. g. hallowelli</i> as mapped by Kirn <i>et al.</i> (1949:241). How<!-- Page 627 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</a></span>ever,
for the sample from Kansas, the mean number of subcaudals of males is
well within the diagnostic range for <i>T. g. gracilis</i> (<a href="#Table_6">Table 6</a>), the mean number
of subcaudals of females is closer to the mean of <i>gracilis</i> than it is to the mean
of <i>hallowelli</i> (<a href="#Table_5">Table 5</a>), and the mean of the ratio of tail length to total length
of both sexes is within or very close to the diagnostic range for <i>gracilis</i>
(<a href="#Table_6">Table 6</a>).</p>

<p>Smith and Sanders (1952:218) pointed out an error in the range of subcaudals
in female <i>T. g. gracilis</i> as stated in table 1 (p. 247) of Kirn <i>et al.</i> We<!-- Page 628 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</a></span>
add some additional corrections that should be made on the same page. In
table two, column two ("Sex"), the words "male" and "female" are reversed
for each characteristic. Also, in table two, column four ("Means from data of
Force"), the means for caudals should be corrected from 33.61 to 43.61 in
females and from 39.99 to 50.32 in males, as based on our recalculations from
Force's data; we did not recalculate the means of Force's data for the other
characteristics.</p>

<p>The discussion above demonstrates that the number of subcaudals and the
ratio of tail length to total length are weak characteristics for diagnosing <i>T. g.
gracilis</i> and <i>T. g. hallowelli</i>. The only remaining diagnostic characteristic given
by Kirn <i>et al.</i> (1949) is the number of ventrals. Nevertheless, a step-cline in
the number of ventrals, if one exists, is yet to be demonstrated. Therefore, we
completely agree with Dowling (1957:32), who stated that "... the overlap
in each character is so great that any subspecific differences appear to be as
yet undefined. It is here suggested that <i>T. gracilis</i> be retained as binomial...."<!-- Page 629 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span></p>
